Remember how we used the tidyqant package to download CPI data. In this exercise, I would like you to do the following:

1.  You can find [CPI components at FRED](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843). You should adapt the code from German polls to scrape the FRED website and pull all of the CPI components into a vector. FIY, the list of components is the second table in that webpage.
2.  Once you have a vector of components, you can then pass it to `tidyquant::tq_get(get = "economic.data", from =  "2000-01-01")` to get all data since January 1, 2000
3.  Since the data you download is an index with various starting dates, you need to calculate the yearly, or 12-month change. To do this you need to use the `lag` function, and specifically, `year_change = value/lag(value, 12) - 1`; this means you are comparing the current month's value with that 12 months ago lag(value, 12).
4.  I want you to order components so the higher the yearly change, the earlier does that component appear.
5.  You should also make sure that the **All Items** CPI (CPIAUCSL) appears first.
6.  Add a `geom_smooth()` for each component to get a sense of the overall trend. 1 You may want to colour the points according to whether yearly change was positive or negative.

Having done this, you should get this graph.

```{r cpi, out.width="100%"}

# save the url
url <- "https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843"

# read the table
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css = "table")

# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called cpi_data
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
cpi_data <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill = TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())

# we need the second table
cpi_components <- cpi_data[[2]]['series_id'] %>%
  tidyquant::tq_get(get = "economic.data", from = "2000-01-01")

# then we need to add titles of cpi components
cpi_components_with_titles <- cpi_components %>%
  inner_join(cpi_data[[2]][c('series_id','title')],by = 'series_id') %>% 
  # then do the string processing to get the proper title
  mutate(title = str_sub(title,47,-22)) %>% 
  # then we calculate the yearly change of the CPI
  mutate(year_change = price/lag(price, 12) - 1) %>% 
  # and order components
  arrange(desc(year_change))

# then make all items appear first
# first extract rows of all items
cpi_all_items <- cpi_components_with_titles %>% 
  subset(series_id == "CPIAUCSL")
# then delete these rows in original df
cpi_without_all <- cpi_components_with_titles %>% 
  filter(series_id != "CPIAUCSL")
# then put the table of all items at the top of the latter one
cpi_components_sorted <- rbind(cpi_all_items,cpi_without_all)

# calculate the max of yoy change per component to get the order of labels later in the subplots
cpi_componets_order <- cpi_components_sorted %>% 
  # filter the data according to date at first
  filter(date >= as.Date("2016-01-01") & date <= as.Date("2021-08-01")) %>% 
  # group by title
  group_by(title) %>% 
  # calculate the max
  summarise(change = max(year_change, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  # display in desc order
  arrange(desc(change))

# create the subplot order
subplot_order1 <- cpi_componets_order['title'] %>%
  # delete all items in the df
  filter(title != "All Items")
# add the all items to the top row and get the order
subplot_order <- rbind('All Items', subplot_order1)

cpi_components_sorted$title <-
  factor(cpi_components_sorted$title,
    ordered = TRUE,
    levels = subplot_order$title,
    labels = subplot_order$title)


# finally we make the plot
cpi_components_sorted %>% 
  # filter the data according to date at first
  filter(date >= as.Date("2016-01-01") & date <= as.Date("2021-08-01")) %>%
