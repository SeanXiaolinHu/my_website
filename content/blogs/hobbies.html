<p>As introduced in the bio part, I love listening to music and watch movies! My favorite music genres are pop, country and house, and the most frequent song I have kept listening to is Love Story by Taylor Swift. As for movies, I really love action movies and thrillers, and I swear I will go to watch Dune after the finals!</p>
<p>In terms of outside activities, I like playing badminton and running, and recently I have started doing gym to try to build more muscles! Itâ€™s worth speaking that I also have a weird hobby in public transportation! Sometimes, I would rather spend a whole afternoon watching trains passing by or sitting at the front row of bus to watch the city.</p>
<p>Recently, I have also try to develop some new hobbies. For example, I am learning video clipping now and bacame a new video creator in Bilibili, one of the most popular video platforms in China. If I successfully find a job, I also want to learn dancing.</p>
<p>By the way, I also like photography and travelling, below you can find some photos I took:</p>
