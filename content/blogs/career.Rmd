Hi everyone! As a MFA student from LBS, my career goal may be a a little bit different from that of my cohort. After conducting several internships in both finance and tech industry, I find Big Tech and Fintech really attracting to me. 

During my past study and interns, I have cultivated my learning ability and also sharpened my logical thinking mindset. With all the techniques I developed including Python, R, SQL, etc. and my communication skills, I am committed to find a role as a business analyst in a tech company, especially within the fintech sector.

Below you can kindly find my CV:
