<p>Hi everyone, my name is Xiaolin Hu, a student in MFAâ€™22 program at London Business School. I come from China, and completed my bachelors study in Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. My hometown is Chengdu, the place of panda and hotpot! In my spare time, I like to listen to music and watch movies, and I am also attracted by public transportation! Sometimes, I just find hanging around in the city or go hiking really refreshing to me. Below you can find a very short bio of myself:</p>
