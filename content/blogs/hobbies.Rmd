As introduced in the bio part, I love listening to music and watch movies! My favorite music genres are pop, country and house, and the most frequent song I have kept listening to is Love Story by Taylor Swift. As for movies, I really love action movies and thrillers, and I swear I will go to watch Dune after the finals!

In terms of outside activities, I like playing badminton and running, and recently I have started doing gym to try to build more muscles! It's worth speaking that I also have a weird hobby in public transportation! Sometimes, I would rather spend a whole afternoon watching trains passing by or sitting at the front row of bus to watch the city.

Recently, I have also try to develop some new hobbies. For example, I am learning video clipping now and bacame a new video creator in Bilibili, one of the most popular video platforms in China. If I successfully find a job, I also want to learn dancing.

By the way, I also like photography and travelling, below you can find some photos I took:

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.align = "center"
)
```

```{r out.width='70%',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/hobby2.jpg",error =FALSE)
```


```{r out.width='70%',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/hobby3.jpg",error =FALSE)
```


```{r out.width='70%',echo=FALSE}
